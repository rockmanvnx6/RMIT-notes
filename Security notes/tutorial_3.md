# Q1

**a. To check if a number n is a prime number. devide the integer from 2 to $sqrt(n)$ to see if there is no remainder**

**b.** Find the greatest common devisor (GCD)

8 and 12:

8 = 2.2.2

12 = 2.2.3

​	multiply the common prime factor: 2*2 = 4

​	GCD(8,12) == 4;

**c.**

GCD (9,21):

9 = 3*3

21 = 3*7

​	common = 3;

​	GCD(9,21) = 3;

**d.**

gcd(9,11);

9 = 1*9

11 = 1*11;

​	common = 1;

​	gcd(9,11) == 1.

if `gcd(a,b) == 1`. We call them **co-prime.**

**e.**

51 mod 5 = 1;

**f.** find 2 coprime number.

- For this task, just pick two random number because the chance is 60% you can get a co prime.

**g.** 6 & 30 coprime ?

no. gcd = 6;

**h.** LCM(30,60) && LCM(14, 21)

LCM(30,60) = 60. Because 60 is divisible by both 30, 60.

$lcm(n,m) = (m*n) / gcd(m*n)$
