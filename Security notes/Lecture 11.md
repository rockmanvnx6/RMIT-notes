#  Exam revision

## Lecture 1

- ceaser cipher
  - Shift by a number
- double transposition
  - Swap row and col to get the correct plaint text

## Lecture 2

- One time pad
- Stream ciphers. - Use random key stream to perform one time pad. However it's not secure as one time pad. 

## Lecture 3

- public key encryption and decryption
- RSA.
- Prime factorization - to break RSA.

## Lecture 4

- Elgamal.
- RSA signature, signing and verification.

## Lecture 5

- Privacy
- RSA homomorphism: multiplying two number secretly.

## Hint and tips

4 parts

mostly solving problem, not definition.

Q1. basic encryption

- 3 short questions, 6 marks.

- Example: ceasar cipher, double transposition, one-time pad, stream cipher (if happens just principle).

- Preparation: lecture 1-2
- focus on tut, assignment questions.

Q2.

- Public key encryption - 4 questions - 15 marks
  - Encryption/ Decryption RSA, Elgamal. **no paillier**.
  - Privacy, add, multiplication
  - Breaking RSA.
  - conceptual things.
- Preparation: lecture 3 RSA, 4 Elgamal, 5 - privacy

Q3.

Signature - 4 short questions - 13 marks

- RSA, Elgamal signature key
- 3 conceptual questions

- Preparation: lecture 6.

Q4. Block chain and security protocol. - 16 marks

Example:

- Authentication , Authorization (3 short questions)
- Blockchains (3 short questions)
  - data integrity
  - proof of work
  - concensus
  - marc-tree
  - Important data integrity with examples.

inverse mod type: $7^{-1}mod23$
