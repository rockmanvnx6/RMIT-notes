## Usability

> How the product is used by the users. What's the initial goal. What's the product for?

**Usability is the out come of UCD - user center design**

A good Usability has 3 features:

- Engage [how to use me]
- Enable [how to use me to achieve your task]
- Empower [how well do you understand my role in achieving your role]

## Nielsen's components of usability

**Learnability**: How easy for the users to use it

**Efficiency:** How quickly they can peroform the task.

**Memorability:** When users return the design after a period of not using it. How easily can they re-establish proficiency.

**Errors**: How many errors do users make. How severe are these error and how easily can they recover the errors

**Satisfaction:** How pleasant is it to use the design.
